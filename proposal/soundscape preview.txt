My soundscape outlines the location of the story. It should be clear to the listener that the general setting of the soundscape is somewhere cold and wooded. The noise of stepping through snow should feel authentic. The walking slowly turns to speed-walking, and this turns to jogging. This should instill a sense of urgency in the listener. In addition, the snow is unpacked which shows that the individual walking is not on a well defined path. They are not traveling through the route that took them there. Instead, they are navigating alone. I hope to make the recording sound as though the individual was being chased by something that they felt was following or tracking them. I am still brainstorming what obstacles will be on the path or the context of the chase. I know for sure, that I want the main character to wander on to a frozen lake. The purpose of the falling trees is to show that the person or thing chasing the individual walking has the potential to be very large. 
        Next, I plan to locate more sounds and begin layering what I have. I will also complete a plot that gives a decent outline to what exactly I want to happen. I have a few sounds that I have to record. I have a rough idea of what my soundscape will be and I feel that I will have no trouble converting my ideas into a completed soundscape.
